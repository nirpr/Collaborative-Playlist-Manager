# Collaborative Playlist Manager ðŸŽµ

**Status:** ðŸš§ In Production

## Overview

Collaborative Playlist Manager is a web application that allows multiple Spotify users to contribute songs to a shared playlist. Each participant logs in with their Spotify account, and the app selects a number of songs from each user's library to populate the playlist. 

Participants can then vote on songs within the playlist, and the song with the highest votes will play next. If there is a tie or no votes, Spotify's regular shuffle algorithm will be used.
